# **Fine-Tuning FLAN-T5 with Reinforcement Learning for Detoxified Summaries**  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project fine-tunes **FLAN-T5** using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to generate detoxified text summaries, reducing bias and harmful content. By leveraging **reward models**, we improve text safety while maintaining coherence and fluency.  

## 🏆 Key Features  
- **Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model** for safe and detoxified text summarization.  
- **Reinforcement Learning with Reward Models** for guided text generation.  
- **Hugging Face Transformers & RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Toxicity reduction, BLEU, ROUGE, and fluency scores.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Model:** FLAN-T5 (Fine-Tuned Large Language Model)  
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **RL Techniques:** PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), Reward Modeling  
- **Libraries:** 🤗 Datasets, 🤗 Accelerate, OpenAI Detoxify  
- **Deployment:** Colab, AWS, or Local GPU  

## ⚡ Setup & Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/snkpgithub/GenerativeAI-Fine-tune-FLAN-T5-with-reinforcement-learning.git  
cd GenerativeAI-Fine-tune-FLAN-T5-with-reinforcement-learning  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  
Ensure you have the necessary **Hugging Face models & datasets** downloaded.  

## 📌 Usage  
Run the **training script** to fine-tune FLAN-T5 with RLHF:
